NOROFF - Semester Project 01 - Front End Development

## Description

For this project, I designed and developed a web page for the community science museum, specifically targeting children aged 7-15. The primary goal was to create an engaging, educational, and user-friendly experience for young visitors. I was provided with the necessary text and images, which gave me a solid foundation to start with. However, the creative freedom allowed me to truly make the project my own. By carefully considering the target audience, I ensured that the content was both informative and appealing, using visuals and interactive elements to capture their interest.

To enhance the website’s appeal, I chose a light-themed color palette, which gave the site a bright and inviting appearance. I maede the design elements, focusing on readability and ease of navigation to ensure a seamless user experience. This included selecting appropriate fonts, creating an intuitive menu, and integrating engaging visuals. My aim was to make the museum’s online presence as dynamic and fascinating as the exhibits themselves, sparking curiosity and encouraging further exploration among young users. Through this project, I was able to combine technical skills with creative design, resulting in a web page that effectively communicated the museum’s mission to inspire and educate.
